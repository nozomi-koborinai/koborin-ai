## About This Garden

This is a personal technical garden where I explore, document, and share my journey through modern software development. Like a garden that grows over time, this site continuously evolves with new insights, experiences, and learnings.

Here, you'll find my explorations in:

- **Cloud Architecture**: Serverless applications, Google Cloud Platform, Infrastructure as Code, DevOps, Identifier
- **Developer Experience**: Tools and practices that make development more enjoyable and productive
- **AI & Modern Development**: Genkit, Firebase, and emerging technologies
- **Software Craftsmanship**: Design patterns, DDD, clean architecture, and quality practices

## About Nozomi Koborinai

<img src={profileImage.src} alt="Nozomi Koborinai speaking at a tech conference" style="border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

I graduated from an IT technical college in March 2019, where I built my foundation in object-oriented programming with Java.

Over my 6 years of experience, the first four were spent developing electronic medical record systems using C#, teaching at Flutter University (Japan's Flutter engineering community), and co-authoring books on Flutter design patterns. Currently, I work at a Google Cloud Partner company in Japan, specializing in **Serverless Application development** (Google Cloud, Firebase, DevOps, IaC, Identifier). My deep interest in software architecture has made me proficient in ensuring quality through DDD and clean architecture principles.

### Recognition & Community

- **Google Cloud Partner Top Engineer (Serverless App Development) 2025 & 2026** - Japan-exclusive award program
- Contributor to [**genkit-ai**](https://github.com/genkit-ai) organization, including developing the Dart client for Genkit
- Author and maintainer of [**Mastering Genkit**](https://github.com/mastering-genkit) book series
- Speaker at **Google I/O Extended Tokyo** and **GDG DevFest**
- Former instructor and current 1-on-1 mentor at **Flutter University**

I believe that promoting good products is essential for energizing developer communities. Driven by my passion for great products and developer communities, I feel a strong mission to spread their value worldwide. Deeply impressed by Firebase's exceptional developer experience, I explored Genkit and was captivated by its innovative approach.

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy:

- 🎸 **Music**: Guitar playing and beat-making
- 📚 **Reading**: Exploring new ideas and perspectives
- 🌱 **Open Source**: Contributing to projects that improve developer experience

**Improving developer experience is at the heart of my work and brings me the greatest joy.**

## Why koborin.ai?

The name **koborin.ai** carries a meaningful play on words:

- **koborinai** - My family name, representing my personal identity
- **koborin.ai** - The domain combining my nickname with the `.ai` TLD, symbolizing the intersection of personal journey and technology
- **AI Explorer** - Reflecting my dedication to exploring and contributing to AI-powered products and frameworks like Genkit

This dual meaning captures both who I am and what I'm passionate about: bridging traditional software craftsmanship with cutting-edge AI technologies, always with a focus on exceptional developer experience.
