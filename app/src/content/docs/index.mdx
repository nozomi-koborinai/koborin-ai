### Background

I graduated from an IT technical college in March 2019, where I built my foundation in object-oriented programming with Java.

During my first four years, I developed electronic medical record systems using C# / VB.NET, taught at App University (Japan's app development engineering community), and co-authored a book on Flutter design patterns.

Currently, I specialize in **Serverless Application Development** (Google Cloud, Firebase, DevOps, IaC, Identity & Access Management).

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy:

- 🎸 **Music**: Guitar playing and beat-making ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cobo_poly))
- 📚 **Reading**: Exploring new ideas and perspectives
- 🧖 **Digital Detox**: I value downtime in baths and saunas above all else

**Work hard, rest well.**

## Why koborin.ai?

- **koborinai** is my family name
- **koborin** is my nickname
- **koborin.ai** = nickname + `.ai` TLD

I frequently work with AI-related products like Genkit, and with the rise of Agentic AI, the `.ai` domain feels like a natural fit.

Feel free to explore this garden—I'll keep tending to it bit by bit.
